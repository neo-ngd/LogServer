    "name": "ngd",//the name of your node, let partners to recognize you
    "cnport": 8080, //the port to receive log from cn-node and partners
    "webport": 8081,//the port to serve websocket
    "logpath": "./persist",//directory to store the log
    "logname": "concensus.log",//log file name
    "logfileexpire": 30,//day, how many days you want to store the log
    "logfilesplit": 1,//hour, how many hours to split the file
    "sendto":[//partners you want to send your log
           "http://ngd1.logbackend:8081"
    ]
}
```

> if you want to send your consensus node logs to partners, set your partners' LogServer url in "__sendto__"

> set your node name to let partners recognize you, you can not use "" and "~~local~~", becase local is reserved for your consensus node, LogServer use name to set in Http Header "From" when sending to partner.

> "__cnport__ " is for serving cn-node LogPlugin, see [LogPlugin](https://github.com/neo-ngd/LogPlugin)
